To run experiments:

Make sure Python version 3.8 or later is installed, along with sci-kit learn, pandas, and matplotlib.

Extract files to a location of your choice.

In Anaconda3 or other shell that can run python code, navigate to the directory where you extracted your files using cd "[file-path]" and hit enter.

To run Text Classification Experiment: type "python TextClassification.py" into your shell and hit enter.

To run Drug Classification Experiment: type "python DrugClassification.py" into your shell and hit enter.

NOTE: this will create output files in the same directory you are located the first time you run the experiments. Any subsequent experiment will append its results to the appropriate file (pdfs of graphs will be replaced). If you wish to create a new file every time, please delete the old output files or move them to a different directory.

All output files created from my experiments are included in the "Output" folder.

"bbc-discussion.txt" and "drug-discussion.txt" will not be created by the experiments. They can only be found in the "Output" folder.
