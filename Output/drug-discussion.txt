2.8
From the multiple times running my experiment, I noticed that the same model did not give me the same result every time. I can boil this down to two main factors. The first is the way the sample is split into train and test samples. Since the distribution between drugs is so uneven, there may not be enough evidence to put any test sample into the drugA, drugB or drugC categories. This results in most samples being put into drugX and drugY. Another reason is because the MLPs do not have enough iterations to properly complete. I could increase the maximum number of allowed iterations, but this would cause the program to take a long time to execute.

These two factors also results in a lot of warnings being thrown when I run the experiment. The first is the max number of iterations reached when running the MLPs. The second is a potential division by 0 when calculating F1 score. This is because precision and/or recall for drugA, drugB, or drugC may be 0 due to the aforementioned issue.
